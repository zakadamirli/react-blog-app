# React Blog Platform

This project is a React application that manages and displays a list of posts. The `Home` component fetches posts from an API, displays them to users, and allows users to add new posts. Itâ€™s designed to practice handling asynchronous data fetching, error handling, and rendering updates in real-time.

## Project Purpose

- **Displaying Posts**: Fetches data from an API to display posts to users.
- **Error and Loading States**: Manages errors and loading states during data fetching.
- **Adding New Posts**: Provides a form to add new posts to the existing list dynamically.

## Key Features

- **Data Fetching (`fetchPosts`):**  
  Fetches data from the `/posts` endpoint using the `fetch` API.
  
- **Error Handling:**  
  Displays error messages in case of network or server errors.

- **Dynamic List Refresh:**  
  Automatically refreshes the post list after a new post is added.
